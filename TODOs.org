** Performance

*** TODO Look into using Celluloid and/or jruby to improve performance
          Thinking about concurrency for performance improvements

          read base
          read local
          read remote

          base + local -> diff l
          base + remote -> diff b

          diff l + diff b -> conflict detection

          cd -> each conflict type

          conflicts -> conflict resolution

          cr (user response)

          serialize result (single)


** Diff/Merge

*** Conflicts can happen on the same diff 2x. How to handle this?
*** DONE In `Change.to_s` - deref args that point to other elements (like archimate_element)
    CLOSED: [2017-02-01 Wed 12:48]
*** In Diagram children diffs - make to_s reference the parent diagram
*** DONE Array diffs on non-id'd diffable elements should detect changes rather than delete/insert
    CLOSED: [2017-02-01 Wed 12:48]
*** Archi file could have ids that conflict (i.e. 2 relationships with same id - this is bad!!! Was it a bad merge or something worse)
*** Implement check for de-duplicated merges
*** DONE Add a summary diff - elements added/changed/deleted, diagrams
    CLOSED: [2017-02-01 Wed 12:48]
